# fantasyPowerRankings
This script will output a txt and pdf file for rankings
- the pdf will have the nicely formatted rankings
- the txt will have the metadata:
 - everyone's ranking

This will be a command line script. It will give you the previous weeks rank
and ask for this week's.  For each team in the rank, it will ask for a blurb.
This will be outputted to a pdf (later I would like to add in dynamically-added images).

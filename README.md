# fantasyPowerRankings
This script will output a txt and pdf file for rankings

- It gives the matchups for the week
- It shows how you would match up against the whole league

######NOTE: I'm trying out these two tools for writing
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-working-with-docx-module/
  - https://python-docx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
- https://pyfpdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
  - use either of these fonts to display Unicode team names: 
    - https://sourceforge.net/projects/dejavu/
    - https://www.fontspace.com/symbola-font-f22021

TODO:
1. Add in team names to stats in the PDF (I just have owner names right now)
2. Add in lineup efficiency stat
3. Add in a way to track league record over the season
4. Add in graphs for things like points for for the whole season
5. Create way to power rank teams
